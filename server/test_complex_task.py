    description = """You are a senior full-stack engineer Aetherium. Your task is to generate production-grade code for an Aetherium-powered, agentic e-commerce meta-platform that integrates East African vendors, shops, and e-commerce sites.

üîë Key Features to Implement

Customer Side:
- Chat-first shopping assistant (Aetherium-powered).
- Product comparison (price, vendor, delivery ETA, logistics, quality score).
- Live offers ticker (real-time streaming promotions tagged with vendor identity).
- Map pinning for delivery/pickup.
- Product categories (fashion, groceries, electronics, medical, etc), with support for dynamic expansion.

Vendor Side:
- Vendor portal (manage products, offers, logistics settings).
- Products must always be tagged by vendor.
- Vendors can create promotions and discounts.

Agentic System (event-driven microservices/workers):
- Price Watcher Agent ‚Üí monitors product prices across vendors.
- Offer Curator Agent ‚Üí prioritizes and streams offers.
- Fraud & Quality Agent ‚Üí flags anomalies/counterfeit items.
- Category Evolution Agent ‚Üí suggests new categories based on trends.
- Logistics Optimizer Agent ‚Üí recommends delivery partners.
- Onboarding Assistant Agent ‚Üí extracts product details from vendor uploads (text/image).
- Customer Service Copilot ‚Üí Aetherium-driven FAQ + escalation.

üèóÔ∏è System Requirements
- Frontend: Next.js (TypeScript, Tailwind, ShadCN UI), chat-first UX, minimal pages.
- Backend: Python (FastAPI) microservices.
- Data Layer: PostgreSQL (core data), Elasticsearch (search), Redis (cache + pub/sub), S3 storage (images).
- Realtime: WebSockets/Event streams (offers, chat, order tracking).
- Aetherium Gateway: LLM for chat & recommendations, embeddings for semantic search.
- Payments: Mobile money integration (M-Pesa, Airtel).
- Security: Vendor KYC, RBAC, audit logs, API rate limiting.

üìÇ Expected Output Format
Generate code for all services and frontend in the proper directory structure with database schema, event schema, and OpenAPI specs."""

# Backend Capabilities: CodeAgent System

The CodeAgent backend is an autonomous Aetherium-powered development platform designed to streamline software development processes through a modular microservices architecture. It leverages advanced Aetherium providers and specialized agents to handle various aspects of code development, testing, deployment, and monitoring via RESTful APIs.

## Core Services

### Orchestrator

- Central FastAPI-based service that coordinates all operations and manages workflows across the platform.
- Handles task planning, routing, and execution orchestration.
- Provides authentication and database integration.

### Specialized Agents

- **fix_implementation**: Code fixing and implementation using Aetherium analysis.
- **debugger**: Debugging assistance for error identification and resolution.
- **review**: Code review and quality assessment.
- **deployment**: Deployment automation workflows.
- **monitoring**: System and performance monitoring.
- **testing**: Automated testing capabilities.
- **security**: Security analysis and vulnerability detection.
- **performance**: Performance optimization and analysis.
- **comparator**: Code comparison, diff analysis, linting, and scoring.
- **feedback**: User feedback processing and integration.

### Aetherium Providers

- Integration with multiple Aetherium models: Mistral, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, NVIDIA NIM, and local HuggingFace models.
- Modular adapter system for easy provider switching and management.

### Supporting Backend Services

- **sandbox_executor**: Isolated code execution environment for safe testing.
- **tool_api_gateway**: API gateway for external tool integration and security.
- **comparator_service**: Advanced code comparison with parallel running, performance checking, and security scanning.
- **vector_store**: Vector database for embeddings and semantic search.
- **prompt_store**: Storage for Aetherium prompts and templates.
- **transcript_store**: Conversation and interaction logs.
- **observability**: Monitoring and logging infrastructure.
- **policy_engine**: Governance and policy enforcement.
- **storage**: General object storage via MinIO.

## Key Capabilities

### Code Development and Management

- Autonomous code generation, fixing, debugging, review, testing, and deployment.
- Intelligent task planning and workflow coordination.
- Code comparison and quality scoring.

### Security and Compliance

- Vulnerability detection and security scanning.
- Policy enforcement and governance.
- Safe code execution in isolated environments.

### Aetherium Integration and Intelligence

- Multi-provider Aetherium model support with unified interfaces.
- Advanced prompt management and optimization.
- Feedback-driven continuous improvement.

### Infrastructure and Observability

- Comprehensive monitoring and logging.
- Scalable containerized architecture with Docker.
- Database (PostgreSQL), caching (Redis), and object storage (MinIO).

### API Endpoints

- RESTful APIs for task submission, status monitoring, and result retrieval.
- External tool integration through API gateway.
- Authentication and security controls.

The backend provides a complete autonomous development ecosystem built with FastAPI, supporting complex software engineering tasks while maintaining security, performance, and quality standards through modular, containerized services.

## UI-Backend Interaction

The React-based UI interacts with the backend through WebSocket connections for real-time communication:

- **WebSocket Endpoint**: `ws://localhost:8000/ws`
- **Task Submission**: Sends JSON messages in format `{ "type": "task", "task": "task description" }`
- **Status Updates**: Receives real-time status updates in format `{ "type": "status", "status": "idle|pending|running|completed|error", "progress": 0-100 }`
- **Output Streaming**: Receives agent outputs in format `{ "type": "output", "message": "output text" }`

## Frontend Generation Prompt

```json
{
  "prompt": "Create a modern React frontend application that connects to a CodeAgent backend via WebSocket. The application should include:\n\n1. A task submission form with a textarea for task description and submit button\n2. Real-time task status display showing current status (idle, pending, running, completed, error) and progress bar\n3. Live output display showing streaming agent messages with timestamps\n4. Clean, professional UI using Tailwind CSS for styling\n5. WebSocket connection to ws://localhost:8000/ws for real-time communication\n6. Error handling for WebSocket connection failures\n7. Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile\n\nKey components needed:\n- App.jsx: Main component managing WebSocket connection and state\n- TaskForm.jsx: Form for submitting tasks\n- TaskStatus.jsx: Display for task status and progress\n- AgentOutput.jsx: Display for streaming outputs\n\nUse React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) and ensure the UI gracefully handles backend disconnection."

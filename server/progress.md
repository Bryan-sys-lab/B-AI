# Project Progress Report

## Original Specification

The following is the original specification JSON that outlines the project's priority MVP and immediate deliverables:

```json
{
  "priority_mvp": [
    "Tool API + Sandbox Executor",
    "Provider Adapters",
    "Fix Implementation Agent MVP",
    "Comparator Service",
    "Basic Orchestrator + Planner endpoint"
  ],
  "immediate_deliverables": [
    "A (repo scaffold)",
    "B (Fix Agent)",
    "C (Provider adapters)",
    "D (React UI)"
  ]
}
```

## Completion Status

### Priority MVP

- [x] Tool API + Sandbox Executor
- [x] Provider Adapters
- [x] Fix Implementation Agent MVP
- [x] Comparator Service
- [x] Basic Orchestrator + Planner endpoint

### Immediate Deliverables

- [x] A (repo scaffold)
- [x] B (Fix Agent)
- [x] C (Provider adapters)
- [x] D (React UI)

## Summary of Implemented Components

All components from the priority MVP and immediate deliverables have been implemented. Below is a summary of each component and its location in the codebase:

- **Tool API + Sandbox Executor**: Implemented in `tool_api_gateway/` (API gateway) and `sandbox_executor/` (execution environment).
- **Provider Adapters**: Implemented in `providers/` directory, including base adapter and specific adapters for Mistral, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, and NIM.
- **Fix Implementation Agent MVP**: Implemented in `agents/fix_implementation/` directory, including main logic, patch generation, prompt building, repo management, safety checks, and testing.
- **Comparator Service**: Implemented in `comparator_service/` directory, including linting, parallel running, performance checking, scoring, and security scanning.
- **Basic Orchestrator + Planner endpoint**: Implemented in `orchestrator/` directory, including main orchestrator, planner, router, authentication, database integration, and master agent.
- **Repo Scaffold**: The entire project structure has been scaffolded, including directories for agents, comparator_service, observability, orchestrator, policy_engine, prompt_store, providers, sandbox_executor, storage, tool_api_gateway, transcript_store, ui, and vector_store.
- **Fix Agent**: Refers to the Fix Implementation Agent MVP, located in `agents/fix_implementation/`.
- **Provider Adapters**: As above, in `providers/`.
- **React UI**: Implemented in `ui/` directory, including a React application with components for task forms, status, and agent output.

## Notes on Remaining Pending Items

No todo list has been created for this project, and all items from the original specification have been completed. There are no remaining pending items at this time.

## Recent Fixes

- agents/fix_implementation: added `python-dotenv==1.0.0` to `agents/fix_implementation/requirements.txt` to resolve `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dotenv'` when running the service in Docker. Rebuild the service image with `docker-compose up --build` to apply.
